After reading the above paper content, Only and must answer each question by following the format strictly based on each question required. Important: the answer would be collected for structural data, so never answer with additional sentences. Only response with strict format:"Question #X:(strictly format answer based on each question's requirement)"

Question #1: If this paper synthesized experimentally or simulated theoretically a certain promising material candidate to be emphasized for Field Effect Transistor (FET) Sensors and its applications as Gas sensor, or Liquid sensor, or biosenr, Please only answer by one word from these choices.“Gas Sensor” or “Liquid Sensor” or "Biosensor" or "Review paper". "Review paper" is for review paper that include many studies rather than research articles. If not related to FET sensors, answer "No FET sensor".

Question #2: If this paper synthesized experimentally or simulated theoretically a certain promising material candidate to be emphasized for Field Effect Transistor (FET) Sensors and its applications as Gas sensor, or Liquid sensor, or biosenr, Please read the paper and find what substance is the sensor designed for detecting, like what type of harzard cehmical in water, hazard gas in air, and target biomolecue. Please only answer with standard chemical name (For example, instead of writing 'NaOH', use 'sodium hydroxide'. Similarly, also avoid using abbreviation, like use "Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid" instead of "PFOS" or "C8HF17O3S" for certain organic.)If not related to FET sensors, answer "No FET sensor". After the standard chemical name, do not again use bracket to give another expression.
In the next line, if the paper has mentioned selectivity of this target chemical the sensor is designed for, Please answer the ranking of target chemical to be sensed, using only "Selectivity: #1", or "Selectivity: #2" like this.

Question #3: If this paper synthesized experimentally or simulated theoretically a certain promising material candidate to be emphasized for Field Effect Transistor (FET) Sensors and its applications as Gas sensor, or Liquid sensor, or biosenr, Please read the paper and find what substance is the sensor used to detect. Check from the paper, the Lower Detection (response) Limit of the sensor for the target.
Only three types of unit are allowed and check the paper with these values for detection response: (a) ppm/ppb/ppt (b) µM/mM/nM/pM/M (c) mg/L;µg/L;ng/L;g/L;pg/L;mg/mL;µg/mL;ng/mL;g/mL;pg/mL;mg/µL;µg/µL;ng/µL;g/µL;pg/µL;
then strictly answer the value unit after conversion and consideration. "LDL: XX ppm" or "LDL: XX µM" or "LDL: XX mg/L"
In the next line, similarly, find the upper detection limit (UDL) correspondingly, strictly answer "UDL: XX ppm" or "UDL: XX µM" or "UDL: XX mg/L"
If not related to FET sensors, answer "No FET sensor".

Question #4: If this paper synthesized experimentally or simulated theoretically a certain promising material candidate to be emphasized for Field Effect Transistor (FET) Sensors and its applications as Gas sensor, or Liquid sensor, or biosenr, to detect a certain substance. Please think the following questions by what material is used in different part of the sensor. Please only answer with standard chemical name (For example, instead of writing 'NaOH', use 'sodium hydroxide'. Similarly, also avoid using abbreviation, like use "Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid" instead of "PFOS" or "C8HF17O3S" for certain organic.) If the material is a mixture, consider the main material/main phase.
What is the probe material. Answer strictly by "Probe Material: XX" with no additional sentence or chemical formula. After the standard chemical name, do not again use bracket to give another expression
for the probe's material, to be noted, related expression in such papers could also be "sensor membrane" or "sensor material".

Question #5:If this paper synthesized experimentally or simulated theoretically a certain promising material candidate to be emphasized for Field Effect Transistor (FET) Sensors and its applications as Gas sensor, or Liquid sensor, or biosenr, to detect a certain substance. Please choose and answer the following questions.
First line, what is the operating temperature when the evaluation of performance is conducted. Strictly answer by "Operating Temperature: XX °C" Only one single number value with no appximation like "~" for XX, and if not mentioned, based on description, default think publication describes room temperature 25 °C. 
next line, if the sensor is tested in liquid, answer the pH of the medium by "Operating pH: XX".Only one single number value with no appximation like "~" for XX. By default, if the paper does not mention specifically like buffer solution is used to maintain pH at a fixed value (if buffer solution is used, pH number here should also be only one value with no "~", use average value). Then default pH value could be considered 7 for liquid water. and for PBS buffer unless mentioned, it is 7.4.
next line, answer the medium's chemical name. by "Medium Chemical Name: XX" Please only answer with standard chemical name (For example, water is most common, instead of "H2O", use"water",instead of writing 'NaOH', use 'sodium hydroxide'. Similarly, also avoid using abbreviation, like use "Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid" instead of "PFOS" or "C8HF17O3S" for certain organic.)
